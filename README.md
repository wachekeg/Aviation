# Analysis of Aircraft Incident Frequencies by Make and Model: Identifying Low-Risk Aircraft for Commercial and Private Operations

Our company is poised to enter the aviation industry by purchasing and managing aircraft for both private and commercial usage, with the goal of expanding its portfolio. Given the inherent dangers associated with aviation, it is imperative to comprehend these risks in order to make well-informed judgments. In order to ensure a safe and successful launch into the market, this project aims to deliver a data-driven examination of aviation safety with a particular focus on finding the lowest-risk aircraft.

This project analyzes Aviation Data collected between 1962 and 2023 to come up with useful insights to guide the company towards finding the lowest risk aircrafts for a new endeavor.
